Part 1. What Cast actually is, and what the docs let you assume.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- p-1 -->
Before any of the failures make sense, you need an accurate mental model of Google Cast. The official documentation gives you a model that works fine for the case it was written for, and quietly misleads you for every other case.

[pause:700ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-1 -->
The model the docs give you.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-2 -->
You have a sender. It is your phone app. You add the Cast SDK, you get a cast button, the user taps it and picks a device. You now have a CastSession. You get a RemoteMediaClient off that session, you hand it a MediaLoadRequest containing a URL and some metadata, and something on the television plays it.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-3 -->
The something on the television is a receiver. In the default case it is a web page, hosted by you, running in a Chrome shell on the Cast device. Google provides a ready-made one so that if your media is just a URL, you do not have to write anything at all.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-4 -->
That model is coherent and it works. It is also almost entirely wrong for an app like NoMercy.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-2 -->
Why it does not fit.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-5 -->
NoMercy already has a television app. A real, native, installed Android TV application with its own player, its own playlist handling, its own subtitle rendering, its own authentication against the user's own media server, and its own real time control channel over WebSocket. It knows how to play the user's library. It does not need to be told a URL.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-6 -->
If you use the documented path, you are asking the Cast SDK to start a second, different playback system on the television, one that knows nothing about any of that. You end up with two players on the same device, competing for the screen.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-7 -->
There is an official answer to this, called Cast Connect. It lets a Cast session launch your native Android TV app instead of a web page, using an Android TV Receiver. This is the right family of solution and NoMercy ended up there. But Cast Connect sits on top of all the same machinery, and the machinery has opinions. The web receiver does not go away just because you declared an Android receiver. It is still there, it is still a fallback, and when the conditions for launching your native app are not met, it is what runs instead.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-8 -->
That fallback is the single most expensive fact in this entire report. It is the source of the hijack, the ANR, and the two month recurring bug.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-3 -->
The three things Cast is actually good for here.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-9 -->
Stripped down to what NoMercy genuinely needed, Cast provides three capabilities that nothing else on the platform provides, and one capability that had to be actively refused.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-10 -->
Discovery, sort of. The Cast SDK can enumerate Cast capable devices on the network. NoMercy also runs its own discovery over its own mDNS service, which is better because it finds NoMercy specific detail, and worse because it only finds devices where the app is currently running. A television with the app closed is invisible to mDNS and perfectly visible to Cast. That difference became a real bug and is covered in part seven.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-11 -->
HDMI-CEC One Touch Play. This is the big one. When a Cast session starts against a television, the Cast receiver stack on that device can send a CEC One Touch Play message over HDMI, which physically wakes the panel and switches the input. There is no public Android API for a third party app to do this. None. Firing a Cast session is the only route a normal app has to it, because the component that sends the CEC message holds a signature level permission your app cannot get. This constraint was discovered by trial, and it comes back in part twelve in a far more painful form.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-12 -->
A system initiated app launch. When Cast Connect launches your Android TV app, the launch is performed by a system component, not by your process. That distinction sounds like bookkeeping. It is the difference between the launch working and the launch being silently dropped, because Android's background activity launch restrictions apply to your process and not to the system's. Parts nine and ten are about learning this the expensive way.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-13 -->
Media loading, which had to be refused. RemoteMediaClient and loadMedia are the centre of the documented API and NoMercy must never call them. If Cast loads the media, Cast owns the playback, and everything NoMercy's own player does becomes a second source of truth fighting the first. The rule that eventually got written down in the new player library's Cast plan is four words long.

[pause:600ms]

[narrator:serious, emphasis]

<!-- p-14 -->
Chromecast is wake-only, never media.

[pause:800ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- p-15 -->
The Cast SDK appears in exactly one place, a component called CastWaker, and only for route selection and the session started callback. Once the session has started and the television is awake with the app in front, Cast has done its job and NoMercy's own protocol takes over. RemoteMediaClient, MediaLoadRequest and loadMedia are not permitted to appear in the codebase at all.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-16 -->
That rule reads as obvious now. It is the distilled residue of about six months of not knowing it.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- h-4 -->
Two subsystems that look like one.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-17 -->
There is a second distinction worth setting up early, because collapsing it caused real bugs.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-18 -->
NoMercy has video casting and it has NoMercy Connect, which is the multi device music system. Both let you push playback from one device to another. They feel like the same feature to a user and they are not the same feature at all.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-19 -->
Connect is NoMercy's own thing, over its own WebSocket hub, with its own device registry, its own active and passive device model, and its own volume semantics. Cast is Google's thing, used only to wake hardware. An audit of the new player library was explicit about the conclusion.

[pause:600ms]

[narrator:serious]

<!-- p-20 -->
Cast is a separate subsystem from Connect. They share nothing but the core plugin base. Do not fold them together.

[pause:800ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- p-21 -->
They do touch in exactly one place: when Connect wants to hand music to a television that is asleep, it uses Cast to wake it, and then goes back to being Connect. Every attempt to make that touch point more integrated than that produced a race condition. Part four is the collection of those races.
