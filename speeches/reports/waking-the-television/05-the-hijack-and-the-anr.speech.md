Part 5. The hijack, four fixes, and the crash that ended them.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:serious]

<!-- p-1 -->
This is the centre of the report. Six commits, one day, the eighteenth of May 2026, ending with a mechanism being deleted because it killed the app on a real device.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-1 -->
The problem.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-2 -->
The Cast Web Receiver was taking the television screen.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-3 -->
Recall from part one that declaring an Android TV Receiver does not remove the web receiver. It is still registered, still a valid target, and under conditions that were not fully understood at the time, a Cast launch would resolve to it instead of to the native app. The web receiver runs inside com dot google dot android dot apps dot mediashell, Google's Cast shell, in its own process, and it displays CastWebContentsActivity.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-4 -->
When that happens, the NoMercy app is pushed off the screen by an activity in another process, and the user is looking at a blank Chromecast page while their television app is still running, invisible, behind it.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-2 -->
Fix one. Reclaim the foreground.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-5 -->
The first commit is titled "strong lock against Cast Web Receiver hijack." Three parts.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-6 -->
On the sender, setStopReceiverApplicationWhenEndingSession true and setResumeSavedSession false, so old sessions do not linger and get resumed into the web receiver.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-7 -->
On the television, a reclaim mechanism. Using ActivityLifecycleCallbacks, detect when the app has lost the foreground, check whether mediashell is on top by looking through ActivityManager dot appTasks, and if so call startActivity with REORDER_TO_FRONT to put NoMercy back.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:tense]

<!-- h-3 -->
Fix two. The check that could never be true.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-8 -->
The second commit, the same day.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-9 -->
ActivityManager dot getAppTasks returns the tasks belonging to the calling application. It does not and cannot return another app's tasks. Searching that list for com dot google dot android dot apps dot mediashell is searching a list that structurally cannot contain it.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-10 -->
So the reclaim check never matched. Not sometimes. Never. The entire mechanism from fix one was a no-op that logged nothing and appeared to be installed correctly.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-11 -->
Replaced with ActivityManager dot getMyMemoryState, which reports the calling process's own importance, so instead of asking "is mediashell on top" the code asks "am I still in the foreground."

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:tense]

<!-- h-4 -->
Fix three. The check that was true at the wrong moment.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-12 -->
The reclaim ran once, 500 milliseconds after losing focus. But mediashell takes roughly two seconds to actually display CastWebContentsActivity. At the 500 millisecond mark, the transition has begun and not finished, and getMyMemoryState cheerfully reports that NoMercy is still foreground, because as far as the process importance bookkeeping is concerned, it is.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-13 -->
So the reclaim looked, saw everything was fine, and went away 1.5 seconds before the hijack happened.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-14 -->
The fix: five staggered attempts at 300, 800, 1500, 2500 and 3500 milliseconds, and the importance check dropped entirely as unreliable, keyed instead on userLeavingNow.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-15 -->
Notice what is happening to the design. Each fix removes a signal that turned out to be untrustworthy and replaces it with more attempts. That is the direction a design goes when nobody has found the real seam yet.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:tense]

<!-- h-5 -->
Fix four. The launch that was not a launch.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-16 -->
The reclaim was now firing at the right times, and still not reclaiming. Under Android's background activity launch restrictions, a plain startActivity from an app that is not in the foreground, with REORDER_TO_FRONT and CLEAR_TOP, resolves to START_DELIVERED_TO_TOP. That result code means the intent was delivered to the activity that is already on top of your own task. It is a front swap within your task. It does not bring your task to the front of the system.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-17 -->
So the call succeeded, returned a success-shaped result, and changed nothing visible.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-18 -->
Replaced with appTask dot moveToFront, plus a delayed follow up startActivity.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:serious]

<!-- h-6 -->
Fix five. Rip it out, it crashed the app.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-19 -->
The fifth commit of the day is titled "rip out Cast reclaim, it ANR'd the app."

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-20 -->
Here is the loop that had been built without anyone intending to build it.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-21 -->
The reclaim was scheduled from MainActivity dot onPause. Five attempts get queued. An attempt calls moveToFront. That brings the activity forward, which fires onResume. Something takes focus again, or the next queued attempt lands, and the activity pauses. onPause fires. Five more attempts are scheduled. Each of those calls moveToFront.

[pause:700ms]

[narrator:tense, emphasis]

<!-- p-22 -->
Every reclaim attempt could produce five more reclaim attempts.

[pause:800ms]

[narrator:serious]

<!-- p-23 -->
On the main thread. The MessageQueue backlogged, the Handler lock seized, and Android killed the process. The device produced an A-P-P dash zero zero four device malfunction report, and the ANR stack trace was pasted directly into the commit message, which is the correct thing to do and also a slightly grim thing to read.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-24 -->
The commit is explicit about what state it leaves things in.

[pause:600ms]

[narrator:serious]

<!-- p-25 -->
The Web Receiver hijack still exists but is far less harmful than the ANR. Real fix needs a different vector: blocking the Cast LAUNCH intent at the receiver side, or a foreground service plus full screen intent path.

[pause:800ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- p-26 -->
Neither of those two vectors was ever implemented in that repository. The hijack was never solved on the old app. Third of the four things still open at freeze.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-7 -->
The knock-on.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-27 -->
A commit in the music player, the same day, names this cascade directly as a contributing cause of an apparently unrelated bug. It refers to "the cast-receiver cascade that ended in an ANR" as part of the reason passive music devices needed their audio engines torn down entirely. Part six is that rewrite.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- h-8 -->
What was actually wrong the whole time.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-28 -->
Every one of these five commits accepts a premise: that the web receiver will take the screen, and that the app's job is to take it back. Under that premise the work is correct and the escalation is logical. Detect better, retry more, use a stronger API.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-29 -->
The premise is wrong. Fighting another process for the foreground on Android is a fight you lose, because the system arbitrates it and the system's rules are not on your side. If the web receiver is winning the launch, the answer is to stop the launch resolving to the web receiver.

[pause:800ms]

<!-- p-30 -->
Which is what the commit message says. It knew... it just did not have the time or the understanding of the launch path to do it, and shipping a hijack was better than shipping a crash.

[pause:1200ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- p-31 -->
The new app got there, eventually, and it turned out to take three separate fixes in three separate codebases, because the same visible symptom had three independent causes. That is parts seven and eight.
