Part 4. Waking a sleeping panel, and the six races underneath it.

The twenty seventh and twenty eighth of April 2026 were spent on one user gesture. Tap a television in the music device picker while the television is off, and have music start playing on it.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-2 -->
Nine commits over two days. Every one of them is a different thing that was silently wrong.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- h-1 -->
The false start.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-3 -->
The morning of the twenty seventh opens with an attempt to try the Cast sender first for television taps, so that the Cast shell fires CEC, and fall back to the WebSocket bus wake if that does not work.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-4 -->
It was reverted the same day.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-5 -->
The reason the ordering mattered is subtle and it took another three days to get right. Treating Cast as the primary and the WebSocket as the fallback means you have to decide when Cast has failed, and the honest answer is that you cannot tell quickly. A Cast session that is going to succeed and a Cast session that is going to fail look identical for several seconds. So the fallback either fires too early, giving you two wake attempts racing, or too late, giving you a dead button.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-6 -->
The design that landed three days later ran the Cast SDK in parallel with the WebSocket wake rather than gating one behind the other. That was better. It was still not right, and part nine is about the day in August, three months later, when it was finally understood properly.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-2 -->
The one thing only Cast can do.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-7 -->
The real attempt is a commit titled "wake TV panel via Cast SDK and keep app foregrounded." Its findings are the load bearing platform facts of this whole report.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-8 -->
Cast route selection is the only path to CEC. Firing HDMI-CEC One Touch Play requires a signature level permission. The Cast shell has it. Your app does not and cannot. Selecting a Cast route is the only mechanism available to a third party application that ends in a television physically turning on. This was discovered by trying everything else first.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-9 -->
MediaRouter returns an empty route list on cold start. The router keeps a cache of known routes. On a fresh process, the cache is empty, and asking for routes gives you nothing rather than an error. You have to start an active scan and wait. Code that reads the route list synchronously and finds nothing concludes there are no televisions, when what actually happened is that it asked too early.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-10 -->
A lingering previous session blocks CEC on a new one. If an old Cast session is still open, starting a new one does not fire One Touch Play. The television stays off and everything else in the flow reports success.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- h-3 -->
The steal race.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-11 -->
The next commit is my favourite bug in the old app, because the failure is so human.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-12 -->
You tap the television in the picker. The phone sends a change device command naming the television. The television begins waking, which takes several seconds, during which it is not yet present in the music hub's list of connected devices. About one second in, the phone's own logic notices that music is playing and no device is currently registered as active, so it helpfully claims itself as the active device and sends a change device command naming itself.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-13 -->
The phone wins. The cast reverts. From the sofa, you tapped the television, the television started to wake up, and then playback snapped back to your phone for no visible reason.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-14 -->
The fix was to only auto claim when no active device is designated at all, which the commit notes matches Spotify's behaviour. That reference is doing real work: when you are building a multi device handoff, the correct semantics are mostly already decided by the apps everybody has used, and copying them deliberately is faster than deriving them.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-4 -->
Four more, in one afternoon.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-15 -->
The picker was passing a ULID where the music hub's change device call expected a device fingerprint. The call did not error. It simply never matched, so success was never recognised.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-16 -->
The wake intent triggered a full UI reload on every cast, even when the app was already on the music route.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-17 -->
The television's Cast receiver message handler did not know about music content at all, only video, so music messages arrived and went nowhere.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-18 -->
A Cast sender fallback was added to the phone's music picker.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:tense]

<!-- h-5 -->
The launch that aborted itself.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-19 -->
The twenty eighth begins with a commit that moves the wake to Cast Connect with a proper Android TV Receiver, and it carries two platform gotchas that are worth the whole commit.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-20 -->
Ending the session too early kills the launch. The code was ending the Cast session 2.5 seconds after One Touch Play fired, on the reasoning that CEC had done its job and the session was just overhead. With androidReceiverCompatible set to true, that teardown aborts the launch intent. The Cast shell logs closed_by_peer and never starts your activity. The television turns on and shows nothing.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-21 -->
Sideloaded builds fail a whitelist check you have never heard of. An APK installed with a plain adb install gets APP_NOT_INSTALLED_BY_WHITELISTED_INSTALLER from Cast, and the launch silently fails. Cast will only launch an app it believes came from the Play Store. The workaround is the dash i com dot android dot vending flag on install, which tells the package manager to record the Play Store as the installing package. NoMercy's deploy dot sh had to carry that flag permanently, purely so that Cast's whitelist check would pass on development builds.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-22 -->
If you do not know that, your Cast Connect integration appears completely broken on every device you own, and works fine for anybody who installed from the store. Which is to say, it appears broken exactly and only during development.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- h-6 -->
Casting from the web, and the backdrop.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-23 -->
Casts originating from the server side, through the sharpcaster library, send a bare Cast launch intent with no DIAL extras attached. The television's handler keyed on those extras to decide the wake was a music wake, so web originated casts launched the app and then did nothing. Fixed by treating a bare launch as an implicit music wake.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-24 -->
Then the Backdrop. The Cast receiver SDK ships a component called Backdrop, the ambient screensaver you see on an idle Chromecast. It was drawing on top of NoMercy's music UI, because the receiver SDK's media manager had no populated media status and concluded nothing was playing. The fix pushes synthetic media info and status so the SDK believes there is media.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-25 -->
The commit is honest about not finishing.

[pause:500ms]

[narrator:serious]

<!-- p-26 -->
Doesn't fully fix the Backdrop overlap when the cast launches against the Web Receiver placeholder session id. That needs a custom Cast Web Receiver page that proxies status to the Android app, tracked separately.

[pause:700ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- p-27 -->
That was still open at freeze. Second of the four.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-7 -->
The rest of the cluster.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-28 -->
A cast with no content ID landed on the music start screen instead of the full player overlay.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-29 -->
A real crash. A twenty second session start timeout fired on a background thread and ran cleanup, which touched Cast SDK objects, which threw "Must be called from the main thread." Fixed by posting cleanup to the main looper. The Cast SDK is main thread only and your timeout handler is not, and those two facts only meet on the failure path, which is the path you test least.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-30 -->
Two unrelated and equally expensive things in one commit on the thirtieth. R8 was stripping Log dot i calls in production builds, so the entire wake and auth handoff flow produced no logs on a real release build. You could not debug the feature on the device where it mattered without rebuilding. And separately: Samsung Wi-Fi stacks silently drop multicast traffic, which kills mDNS discovery of televisions. NsdManager reports success the whole time. The fix is an explicit WifiManager dot MulticastLock, which is one line and completely invisible until you have a Samsung phone in your hand and a television that everybody else can see.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-31 -->
Last of the cluster: music hub initialisation on televisions was a fire once function gated on a feature flag. If the flag had not hydrated yet at boot, which on a television it usually had not, the function no-opped and was never called again. Televisions silently never subscribed to the music hub for the entire life of the process. Replaced with a reactive coroutine that watches for the flag and acts when it arrives.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-32 -->
Hold onto that last one. The identical bug, same shape, same cause, is fixed again in the new app in part seven. Some mistakes are structural enough to survive a rewrite.
