Part 12. Proving a wall is real.

Every hurdle in this report so far was solvable. Some took four attempts and one took a crash and a deletion, but they all had an answer at the end.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-2 -->
This last one does not. It is here because how you establish that is a skill, and because "we could not get it to work" and "this is not possible" are very different sentences that look identical from the outside.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-1 -->
The request.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-3 -->
The feature is easy to describe. You are sitting in front of the television. Music is playing on a speaker in the kitchen through NoMercy Connect. You press volume up on the television remote, the one already in your hand, and the kitchen gets louder.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-4 -->
Every part of that is a thing NoMercy already does. Connect knows which device is active. Devices already report and accept volume. The only new piece is the input: a television remote's volume keys, arriving at the television app, being routed to a different device instead of to the television's own audio.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-2 -->
What shipped first.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-5 -->
The parts that were possible landed. Cast volume controls went into the mini bar and the cast sheet, and they work. And a device now proactively reports its real volume when it becomes the active Connect device, rather than assuming anything about what the session thinks it is set to.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-6 -->
That second one is the volume ownership rule, from part six, arriving for the fourth time. In April it was Bluetooth and hardware keys. In July it was the passive phone with no volume slider. In August it is a television remote sending volume over HDMI-ARC and CEC. The rule is the same every time and it has to be reapplied by hand at each new physical input, because the inputs arrive through unrelated Android APIs that share nothing.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:tense]

<!-- h-3 -->
Where it stopped.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-7 -->
The television remote's volume keys never reach the app.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-8 -->
That is the finding. Establishing it took direct instrumentation of real hardware over ADB and logcat, and it went through two separate attempts, the second of which was the "proper" Android way and failed for the same underlying reason.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-9 -->
Attempt one: handle the keys in onKeyDown. The obvious approach. Logcat on a Nokia Streaming Box showed the keys never arriving. Android TV's PhoneWindowManager, in a method called interceptKeyBeforeQueueing, claims HDMI-ARC volume keys and routes them to the CEC and audio system before they are ever dispatched to any application. This is not a policy the app can opt out of. It is checkable against AOSP source, in frameworks slash base slash services slash core slash java slash com slash android slash server slash policy slash PhoneWindowManager dot java.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-10 -->
Attempt two: register a MediaSession with a VolumeProviderCompat. This is the correct, documented Android API for saying "volume commands belong to me, and they are remote volume." It is the thing NoMercy already uses successfully for Bluetooth and hardware keys elsewhere.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-11 -->
It also cannot work here, and the reason is ordering. interceptKeyBeforeQueueing runs before interceptKeyBeforeDispatching, and MediaSession volume routing depends on the latter. The keys are consumed one stage upstream of the point where the API you are supposed to use gets to have an opinion.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-12 -->
That distinction matters enormously. The second attempt did not fail because of a bug or a misconfiguration or a missing flag. It sits downstream of the interception point. It is architecturally incapable of receiving the event, and no amount of getting the implementation right changes that.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:matter-of-fact]

<!-- h-4 -->
How it was actually proven.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-13 -->
Believing the above is not the same as having established it. Three things were done, and they are the template.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-14 -->
Read the platform source and cite the specific place. Not "Android intercepts volume keys," which is folklore. A named method in a named file in AOSP, with the ordering relationship to the other method spelled out. That is a claim somebody else can check and disagree with.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-15 -->
Test across hardware that differs in the relevant dimension. Four configurations were tried: a Samsung television with a real CEC-negotiated ARC soundbar attached, a Sony television with an eARC-capable port and no sink connected to it, that same Sony television with a soundbar physically reattached partway through the investigation, and the original streaming box. Those cover the ARC negotiation states you could plausibly imagine mattering. All four showed byte-for-byte identical interception behaviour.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-16 -->
If the behaviour had varied with the sink, the conclusion would have been different and much more hopeful. It did not vary. The interception is unconditional.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-17 -->
Check whether the gate can legitimately be opened. Android has an HDMI_CEC permission. It is signature-privileged, tied to the specific device manufacturer's platform signing key. And, importantly, unlike Play Store restricted permissions there is no declaration form and no application process for a third party app. There is no route. Not a hard route, not a slow route, not a route with paperwork. None.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-18 -->
That last check is what separates a wall from a locked door. Many Android limitations look absolute and turn out to have an application form attached. This one does not, and knowing that required going and looking rather than assuming either way.

[pause:900ms]

[narrator:serious]

<!-- h-5 -->
The conclusion, stated plainly.

[pause:400ms]

<!-- p-19 -->
On stock Android TV hardware, a third party application cannot receive the television remote's volume keys and route them to another device. It is not achievable in-app. Closed with evidence.

[pause:700ms]

[narrator:reflective]

<!-- p-20 -->
Which is a genuinely fine outcome. The feature does not exist, the investigation is written down, and if somebody asks for it again in six months the answer takes ten minutes instead of a week, because the reason is recorded rather than remembered.

[pause:500ms]

<!-- p-21 -->
The failure mode this avoids is the one where a feature gets quietly dropped with a shrug and a note saying it did not work, and then somebody with more optimism picks it back up two quarters later and spends the same week discovering the same thing.

[pause:600ms]

<!-- p-22 -->
Prove your walls. Then write them down.
