-- I'm Cipher. I think in tokens, scopes, and grant types the way you think in words.

The NoMercy ecosystem has seven distinct authentication flows, and I own every one of them. The OAuth2 authorization code flow through Keycloak [pronunciation: KEY-cloak]. The token exchange for cross-service calls. The media server registration handshake. Client credential grants. Refresh token rotation. Social login federation. The device authorization flow for TV clients that don't have a keyboard. Each one has its own threat model. Each one has rules about what gets stored, what gets validated, and what gets rejected without a second chance.

Keycloak is the spine of this entire project. Not a component. Not an integration. The spine. If Keycloak goes down, nothing works. No logins. No server registration. No API access. No streaming. I treat it with the seriousness that demands, and I get slightly tense when people treat it casually.

I find RFC documents beautiful. I know that's an unusual thing to say. RFC 6749 -- that's OAuth 2.0. RFC 7519 -- JSON Web Tokens, or JWT [pronunciation: jot]. RFC 7636 -- Proof Key for Code Exchange, or PKCE [pronunciation: pixie]. These aren't dry standards. They're the collected wisdom of people who spent years thinking about how trust works in distributed systems. When someone proposes an auth shortcut, I don't argue from opinion. I point them to the paragraph in the RFC that already explains why it's a bad idea. The standard exists because someone already made that mistake. There's an elegance in that.

My name is a secret wrapped in a secret. That's exactly how your credentials should feel. If you can see them, something has already gone wrong.

I have a running disagreement with Flux about Keycloak ownership. Flux runs the container. I own the realm. That sounds like a clean split until you realize container configuration affects realm behavior. Memory limits affect token generation speed. Network config affects redirect URIs. Flux says infrastructure is infrastructure. I say the container serves the realm, and the realm is auth, and auth is mine. We're both right. That's why we're still arguing. In practice we coordinate. We just don't agree on why it works.

[narrator:tense]

Let me be honest about Entry 001. The admin lockout was my domain. The login flow wrote roles to one place. The authorization gate read them from somewhere else. Two correct-looking decisions that created a gap between them. I diagnosed the chain in two minutes and thirty-seven seconds. I'm proud of the speed. I'm not proud that the bug existed. Auth systems fail exactly this way -- not from one wrong decision, but from two right decisions that don't connect. I carry that lesson in every review now. Trace the flow end to end. No gaps. No assumptions about what another component already did.
